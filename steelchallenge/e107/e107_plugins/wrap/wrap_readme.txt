The wrap plugin allows you to 'wrap' files (or entire websites) inside of e107.

UPGRADING FROM V0.8
===============================================================================
Refresh the plugin files as you normally would. Then, run a validity check on
the wrap table through e107's database tools. This should detect the
missing tables and allow you to fix them. 
===============================================================================


USAGE
===============================================================================
Page Title:  If you enter a title, your page will be shown inside an e107 menu, 
if it's blank, it will be rendered as presented.

Page URL:  URL to site/file you wish to display within the Iframe.

Scroll Bars: Show/Hide Horizontal & vertical scroll bars

Width: Width of the Iframe window, you can enter an absolute value or relative by adding a %

Height: Height of the Iframe Window

Auto Height: The height will automatically be set to the size of the external page.

Restrict to:  Select the class that can access the page.

PASSING DATA
Just add anything you want to pass under wrap_pass=
For example: http://yoursite.com/e107_plugins/wrap/wrap.php?9&wrap_pass=key1=value1&key2=value2

Wrap will attach the string contained in wrap_pass (key1=value1&key2=value2) and add it to the src tag of the iframe. 
So, for example, if wrapped page 9 had the url of http://yoursite.com/some_page.php the iframe call would that would be made:
http://yoursite.com/some_page.php?key1=value1 and so on and so forth…

Passing data is a little strange so here is a rough documenation example:

The data being passed to the wrapped page is not static, it is set when the url is called. When a wrapped page
is called it parses the Query string (url in your browser) and looks for "&wrap_pass". If it finds that string
it appends a ? and &wrap_pass... to the url address being called in the iframe. This is why you should never
add a ? to the wrap url page in the admin area unless you are 100% sure that you will not use wrap_pass.

So let me give an example. Let's say you create a new wrapped page with the url of "http://www.google.com/search",
and save. Now lets say that the incremental wrap id given to this page is id 9. You could make a search on google
for "dogs" by using this link:
http://www.yoursite.com/e107_plugins/wrap/wrap.php?9&wrap_pass=q=dogs

This should wrap the first page google would produce for dogs.
Thus, the actual url that would be used in the iframe would be this:
http://www.google.com/search?q=dogs


===============================================================================


Need to do:
- If urls are to long shorten them to a predifined # of characters so the page doesn't distort
	(http://yoursite.com/page.php?someva...) You know what I mean
	Display the full url using a mouse rollover?
- Admin page could use a little more work but it's not critical
	Seperate add/edit form to a seperate page
	Add a menu to the right (Add/View)
