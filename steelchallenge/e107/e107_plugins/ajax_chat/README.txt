INSTALL NOTES:

upload to your plugins directory.
Set the file permission of chat.txt to 0666

UPDATE 1.1
Created a shortcode to use the feature "anywhere"

To install the shortcode, just copy it into your shortcode directory in e107_files, the plugin must be in the plugin directory.

The shortcode was something I just threw together in a few minutes..so there might be a bug.
if u find any, mail me. ;)

mail me at jvrsoftware@jvrsoftware.co.za if u have any queries or plugin requests.
