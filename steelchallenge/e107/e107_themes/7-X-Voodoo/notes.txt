!!!! NOTES !!!!

1. logo has an fixed size
in the height so don't make it bigger then 
HEIGHT : 116 PX

2. 
Upper right text Keep it short!!!!
it is found here:
 e107admin section---> button: "preferences"-------->Site Information

the line: "Site Tagline:"
 keep short what you fill in there else the theme will fuck up.
